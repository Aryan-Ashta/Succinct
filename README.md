# This is an expo app
## Todo:
 - refactor planning function into multiple functions, one initalizes gemini instance using key, another that takes user input and generates the plan as a stream that's chattable, then function that calls both and returns output
 - find nice components (nativewind/react)
 - redo calendar implementation, create better way to store events
 - add function and modify existing ones so that gemini places scheduled events to finish task
